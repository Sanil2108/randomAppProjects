# randomAppProjects
There are apk files and only the src files
At the moment, the app studyMate does something weird with android marshmallow
the rest work just fine

as for 'just the src files', the apps are too huge for github so i cant upload them
so it includes just the src file

[the main folder]\app\src

and if that is relevant
